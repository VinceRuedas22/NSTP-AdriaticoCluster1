            <h2>Report 1: Survey and On-site Viewing</h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 26, 2025</p>
            <p>Our NSTP-CWTS project, "Project 668: Clean, Green, and Looking Great", focuses on addressing waste management issues in Barangay 668, Ermita, Manila. We identified improper waste disposal, limited segregation bins, and minimal community participation as key challenges. To tackle these, we developed a management plan that includes educational seminars, monthly clean-up drives, waste bin distribution, and coordination with barangay officials to improve collection and monitoring. 

                We also drafted a letter to the barangay captain requesting a meeting to discuss waste concerns and ensure alignment with community needs. Additionally, we are developing a website to provide educational resources, project updates, and a platform for community engagement.</p>

            <h2>Report 2: Tree Planting Initiative</h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 23, 2025</p>
            <p>We recently held a meeting with the Barangay Captain of Barangay 668 to discuss the current situation regarding waste management in the area. During our conversation, the captain shared that the barangay conducts a weekly clean-up drive every Monday, which also includes the vicinity of Dolomite Beach. These efforts are part of their regular initiative to maintain cleanliness and promote environmental responsibility in the community.
                However, the captain noted that there are still areas facing challenges, particularly around Guerrero Street. This location is home to a number of informal settlers, making it difficult for the barangay to enforce regulations and maintain consistent waste management. The captain explained that the lack of authority over these residents often results in unregulated trash accumulation, which remains a persistent concern.
                In light of this, the captain encouraged our group to conduct our own observations and suggest specific improvements based on what we see on the ground. Rather than relying solely on the barangayâ€™s perspective, he believes that our fresh insights and initiatives could help address overlooked issues or bring in new solutions, particularly for problem areas like Guerrero Street. Moving forward, we plan to assess the area ourselves and develop practical recommendations that we can propose in collaboration with the barangay.
